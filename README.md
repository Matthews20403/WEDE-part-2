Changes that I made
•	I unwrapped the anchor tags from a button and wrapped the button with the anchor tag instead.
•	I did add the title “Fifi’s Golden Bakery” on other pages.
•	I removed one image from the about us page as it did not have a purpose to be there and it did not match with the website.
